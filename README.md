# TH Leaderboard WebApp

To run this application you'll need `node` LTS installed, and running this in a *nix environment makes it all a lot easier of course.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/danazkari/th-webapp && cd th-webapp
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

There are some `publish` tasks but you'll need to add your own CNAMEs for [surge.sh][1]. Awesome service btw!

Chef recommendation: Use [vim][2], perhaps my [vim-config][3] will help you out.
